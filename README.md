## A Brief of the Prototype:
Solution: Pace Explorer
The Pace Explorer is an interactive, web-based platform designed to make NASA's PACE (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem) data accessible and engaging to students and educators. It integrates real-world scientific data with educational content, allowing users to analyze and visualize the data through interactive modules, games, and simulations.

How It Works:
Direct Access to NASA’s PACE Data:

Users get real-time access to NASA’s PACE data through the platform, enabling them to interact with actual scientific datasets related to ocean ecosystems and atmospheric conditions.
Interactive and Modular Learning:

The platform offers interactive data visualizations that allow students to explore and analyze the data using various tools like graphs, maps, and charts.
Educational modules are tailored for different age groups, helping users understand the science behind ocean ecosystems, cloud formations, and climate changes.
The modular design of the platform makes it easy to update and expand with new features or datasets.
Community Engagement:

Users can participate in discussions and collaborations through the platform’s community forum, promoting a collaborative learning environment.
Teachers can engage with other educators and students, sharing insights and lesson plans.
Support for Educators:

The platform provides educators with lesson plans, tutorials, and activities that help them integrate PACE data into their curriculum.
Data visualization tools and other resources make it easier for educators to explain complex scientific concepts.
Virtual Lab:

Students can perform experiments and simulations in the platform’s virtual lab, enhancing their hands-on learning experience.
Games and Simulations:

The platform includes games and simulations to help students learn in a fun, engaging way. These elements make the educational process more interactive and enjoyable.
Accessibility Features:

To ensure inclusivity, the platform incorporates accessibility features that make it usable for a wide range of learners, including those with disabilities.
In essence, the Pace Explorer provides an interactive, data-rich environment where students can learn about ocean ecosystems and climate science in an engaging and practical way. It combines education with real-world scientific data, providing a unique learning experience for students and valuable resources for educators​



## Code Execution Instruction:
  **Step-by-Step Instructions**
**1. Clone the Repository**
If the .NET Framework project is hosted on GitHub or another repository, you need to clone it locally. Use the following command in your terminal or Git Bash:
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/your-project.git
Navigate to the project folder:
cd your-project


**2. Open the Project in Visual Studio**
Launch Visual Studio.
From the File menu, choose Open > Project/Solution.
Navigate to the folder where the project was cloned, and select the .sln (solution) file.


**3. Restore NuGet Packages**
.NET projects typically use external libraries managed via NuGet. Visual Studio should automatically restore NuGet packages when you open the project.

To manually restore the packages:

In Solution Explorer, right-click on the solution or the project name.
Select Restore NuGet Packages.


**4. Build the Solution**
Before running the project, build it to ensure there are no compilation errors:

In the Solution Explorer, right-click on the solution or project.
Select Build Solution or press Ctrl + Shift + B.
Ensure that the project builds without any errors.



**5. Configure Database (If Applicable)**
If your project uses a database like SQL Server or Entity Framework, you may need to:
Update the connection string in the app.config or web.config file. Look for a section that might resemble:

Run SQL migrations if using Entity Framework. Open the Package Manager Console from Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console, then run:

**6. Running the Project**

**a. For Console Applications**:
Set the project as the Startup Project by right-clicking on the project name in Solution Explorer and selecting Set as Startup Project.
Run the application by pressing F5 or selecting Debug > Start Debugging.


**b. For Web Applications**:
Set the Web Project as the Startup Project.
Run the project by pressing F5 or selecting Debug > Start Debugging.
The application will launch in your default browser, and the server will be hosted locally (usually at http://localhost:[port]).


**c. For Windows Forms or WPF Applications**:
Set the UI project as the Startup Project.
Run the application by pressing F5 or selecting Debug > Start Debugging.





  
 *The Repository must contain your **Execution Plan PDF**.
